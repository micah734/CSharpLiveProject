# C# Live Project


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>For the lst two weeks of my time at the Tech Academy, I worked with my peers in a team developing a full scale MVC Web application in C# and .Net Framework. I used ths opportunity to learn and develop my skills in Front-End coding and Back-end coding. My job was to do as best as possible in the time alloted. I saw how good developers work with each other and develop a high quality program. I had a wide different number of stories from front-end stories that I am very proud of showcasing my abilities in CSS, HTML and Boostrap. I also had the chance to work on Back-end stories, showing what a Full-Stack Developer would do on a normal basis. I am very proud at the chance I had to work on both types of stories. During this time I also had the chance to learn about more project development using SCRUM and Agile methods.  Throughout all of this, I have learned the necessary skills that I am confident that I will use again and again on future projects.

Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on, along with code snippets and navigations links.</p>

<h2>Back-End Story</h2>
<li><a>Form and Database Creation CRUD</a></li>
<li><a>Picture Upload</a></li>

<h2>Form and Database Creation</h2>

<p> Through this story I had to create an entity model for Cast Members with an Enum, and a Byte[] with required fields and fields that were optional. After creating the model I had to scaffold the CRUD pages with the model using EntityFramework and code-first database.</p>

<h2>Picture Upload to Database</h2>

<p> This story added the functionality to be able to upload a picture to the database. At first I had to convert the picture the a byte[] and finally return the picture back to the database, by converting it back into a picture.</p>
